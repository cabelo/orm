ORM One Remote Monitor : COVID-19 will change people's habits. We will use teaching and remote work (home office) more frequently, schools and companies will need to measure student performance and employee commitment.


## Intel Technologies
oneAPI, Movidius NCS, OpenVINO, Intel Opt ML/DL Framework

## Overview / Usage
COVID-19 will change people's habits. We will use teaching and remote work (home office) more frequently, schools and companies will need to measure student performance and employee commitment.

With convolutional neural networks (oneAPI, openVINO and openCV) we can estimate the level of concentration and behavioral performance.

## Methodology / Approach
Video and remote image processing, using inference, computer vision techniques and deep learning.

## Technologies Used
openVINO

**In the future: the project will use Realsense
